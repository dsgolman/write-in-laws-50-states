"I'm a high-performance athlete living with bipolar disorder who discovered healthcare fraud and is now fighting it in federal court while running for President. 

I train 2-3 hours a day, manage mental illness, build businesses, fight corporate corruption, and refuse to accept that any label defines my limits.

## 💪 THE INTEGRATED NARRATIVE

### **Your Story (Updated):**

"I'm Daniel Golman. I train 2-3 hours every day at elite levels - NFL potential, world-class heavyweight fighter level.

I also live with bipolar disorder openly.

In 2021, I was hospitalized. In 2025, I discovered the hospital committed healthcare fraud. I filed a federal lawsuit 15 days later. Now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit.

I also built a 24/7 mental health app (TalkWithSerenity) because I know what it's like to need help.

I wrote a memoir about my mental health journey (Netflix series coming).

And I'm running for President in 2028 as a write-in candidate.

Because I refuse to accept limitations - whether they're physical, mental, legal, or political.

I'm not running DESPITE my struggles.
I'm running BECAUSE of them.

Because I've seen corruption from inside.
Because I have the discipline to fight.
Because I have the evidence to prove it.
And because I'm not afraid of anything.

Mental + physical strength.
Legal + political action.
Transparency + power.

That's what real leadership looks like.

Don't vote. Write-in. 2028."
