# Fighting Healthcare Fraud: A Personal Mission Becomes Political

*Campaign website updated with civil rights case details and mental health memoir*

## The Case That Changes Everything

In August 2025, I received my medical records from a 2021 hospitalization. What I found wasn't just concerning—it was evidence of systematic fraud.

Within 15 days, I filed a federal lawsuit. That case is now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit, with parallel investigations by:
- Virginia Attorney General
- HHS Office of Inspector General
- Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control

**This isn't just about one patient.** It's about a broken system that exploits the vulnerable.

## From Personal Experience to Presidential Campaign

My mental health journey led me through America's healthcare system. What I discovered there—billing fraud, diagnosis manipulation, and systematic abuse—transformed my experience into a mission.

I'm not running for President *in spite of* my bipolar diagnosis.  
I'm running *because* I've seen the system from the inside and know it must change.

**The full story is now on the campaign website:**
- Healthcare justice case details
- "Experiencing Mania in America" memoir  
- The connection between personal struggle and systemic reform

## Why This Matters for 2028

Most candidates hide their struggles. I'm doing the opposite.

Because **transparency is power.**  
Because **authenticity matters.**  
Because **the American people deserve leaders who fight back.**

This case proves the kind of President I'll be:
- Takes on corporate fraud
- Demands institutional transparency
- Fights for those who can't fight back
- Uses evidence, not empty rhetoric
