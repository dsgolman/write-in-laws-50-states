## 🔗 LINKTREE BIO

### **Linktree Bio (No character limit)**

**Title/Header:**
```
Daniel Golman | Write-In 2028
```

**Bio Section:**
```
Elite athlete. Mental health advocate. Federal court plaintiff.

I train 2-3 hours daily at NFL/world-class heavyweight levels. I also live openly with bipolar disorder.

In 2021, I was hospitalized. In 2025, I discovered systematic healthcare fraud and filed a federal lawsuit. Now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit.

I'm running for President in 2028 because I refuse to accept limitations—physical, mental, legal, or political.

I'm not running DESPITE my struggles. I'm running BECAUSE of them.

Mental illness doesn't define your limits. Your diagnosis doesn't make you weak. And corruption shouldn't go unchallenged.

Don't vote for their options. Write-in for real change.

🇺🇸 Don't Vote. Write-In. 2028 🇺🇸
```

---

### **Alternative Shorter Linktree Bio:**
```
Presidential Candidate 2028 | Elite Athlete | Mental Health Advocate

Fighting healthcare fraud in federal court while training at elite levels and running for President.

215 lbs. NFL potential. Bipolar disorder. Fourth Circuit appeal pending.

Breaking every stereotype about what you can do with mental illness.

This is what real leadership looks like: discipline, transparency, and the courage to fight corruption.

Don't vote. Write-in. 🇺🇸
```

---

### **Alternative Power Statement Bio:**
```
They said mental illness would stop me.

Instead, I:
✓ Train at elite athletic levels (NFL/heavyweight potential)
✓ Built a 24/7 mental health app (TalkWithSerenity)
✓ Discovered healthcare fraud and sued in federal court
✓ Am running for President 2028

Your diagnosis doesn't define your limits.
Corruption shouldn't go unchallenged.
The two-party system needs to be replaced.

I'm Daniel Golman.
Elite athlete. Bipolar advocate. Legal fighter. Presidential candidate.

Don't vote. Write-in. 2028. 🔥
