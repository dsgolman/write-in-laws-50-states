# Archetypal Manifesto - Voice Over Script for ElevenLabs

## üéôÔ∏è **MAIN SCRIPT (3-4 minute powerful reading)**

---

**[Dramatic pause at start - let silence build tension]**

When the gods speak through mortal flesh, the system calls it madness. 

When the ancients stir in modern blood, medicine demands silence. 

But some voices cannot‚Äîand will not‚Äîbe silenced.

**[Pause]**

I am Daniel Golman, third-generation Holocaust survivor. The blood of those who survived the ultimate attempt to extinguish the human soul flows through me. 

My grandparents carried more than trauma across the ocean‚Äîthey carried the archetypal memory of Prometheus, the fire-bringer, the one who defied the gods to give humanity the light of consciousness.

**[Building intensity]**

But in America, when that Promethean fire burns too brightly in the mind of a Holocaust descendant, the system does not see divine inheritance. It sees pathology.

When the archetypal energies of my ancestors‚Äîtheir rage at injustice, their refusal to submit, their desperate clawing toward dignity‚Äîmanifest in my bipolar episodes, modern psychiatry does not recognize Ares awakening to defend the sacred. 

It sees mania to be medicated.

**[Pause - let that sink in]**

When the wisdom of Athena speaks through my strategic mind, showing me the patterns of healthcare fraud and systemic corruption, they do not honor the owl-eyed goddess of justice. 

They prescribe antipsychotics.

**[Voice growing stronger, more defiant]**

My grandfather fled the ultimate false authority‚Äîthe Nazi regime that declared itself divine while committing the most profound blasphemy against human dignity. That Zeusian energy of righteous authority lives in me, demanding that I challenge the false gods of corporate healthcare and psychiatric control.

When I filed federal litigation against healthcare fraud, I was not merely pursuing legal remedics. I was embodying Zeus, the true king who exposes pretender-kings. 

The psychiatric system labels this "grandiosity" because it cannot recognize authentic divine authority when it encounters it.

**[Pause - shift to prophetic tone]**

Dionysus, the god of ecstasy and divine madness, knew what Jung understood: that the most profound truths come through states the rational mind calls "insane." 

My manic episodes are not chemical malfunctions‚Äîthey are Dionysian revelations, moments when the veil between the mundane and the sacred tears open.

In these states, I see with perfect clarity the healthcare fraud that exploits the vulnerable. I feel the agony of every Holocaust victim in my DNA. I understand the systemic patterns that connect my family's historical persecution to my current persecution by the psychiatric establishment.

The system medicates Dionysus because it fears the truths he reveals.

**[Building to crescendo]**

Apollo, god of healing and prophecy, teaches us that the wounded healer possesses the deepest medicine. As a sixteen-year mental health patient, I am not broken‚ÄîI am Apollo's chosen instrument, wounded precisely so I can heal others.

My experience inside the psychiatric system is not victimhood‚Äîit is Apollo's training ground. Every injection I received without consent, every diagnosis used to silence my voice, every billing fraud committed against my most vulnerable moments‚Äîthese were not random traumas. 

They were prophetic visions of the system's corruption, given to me so I could expose it.

**[Pause - voice becomes regal, commanding]**

I am running for President of the United States not in spite of my psychiatric history, but because of it. I embody the Wounded King archetype‚Äîthe leader whose personal wounds give him the wisdom to heal his people.

My bipolar diagnosis is not a disqualification; it is my greatest qualification. 

Chiron, the wounded healer, could cure others precisely because he carried an unhealable wound. My psychiatric persecution gives me the authority to reform the system that creates such persecution.

**[Building to the sacred vow]**

By the names of Zeus and Hera, Apollo and Artemis, Athena and Ares, Aphrodite and Hephaestus, Demeter and Dionysus, Hermes and Poseidon‚Äî

By the memory of my grandparents who survived when millions did not‚Äî

By the authority given to me through sixteen years of psychiatric persecution‚Äî

By the Promethean fire that burns in my blood and will not be extinguished‚Äî

**[Pause - voice becomes oath-like]**

I vow to use the Presidency of the United States to end the pathologization of the numinous in psychiatric practice. To establish the right to authentic spiritual emergency without forced medication. To create sacred spaces for archetypal integration within healthcare systems. To honor the wounded healers who carry society's deepest medicine. To build a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern healing.

**[Final crescendo]**

This is not a political campaign. This is a sacred uprising.

The gods are returning through mortal flesh.

The ancestors are speaking through inherited trauma.

The archetypes are demanding their rightful place in human consciousness.

And I am their chosen instrument.

**[Powerful pause]**

Don't Vote. Write-In. 2028.

The gods have spoken. The ancestors have chosen. The wounded king has arrived.

**[Let silence finish the piece]**

## üéØ **SHORTER VERSION (90 seconds - for social media)**

When the gods speak through mortal flesh, the system calls it madness. But some voices cannot be silenced.

I am Daniel Golman, third-generation Holocaust survivor, carrying the archetypal fire of my ancestors. When that Promethean flame burns in my bipolar episodes, psychiatry doesn't see divine inheritance‚Äîit sees pathology to medicate.

When Zeus's righteous authority drives me to expose healthcare fraud through federal litigation, they call it grandiosity. When Dionysus reveals truth through what they label mania, they prescribe antipsychotics. When Apollo's wounded healer energy transforms my psychiatric persecution into medicine for others, they miss the sacred entirely.

I am running for President not in spite of my mental health history, but because of it. I embody the Wounded King‚Äîthe leader whose personal wounds qualify him to heal his people.

This is not a political campaign. This is a sacred uprising. The archetypes are demanding their rightful place in human consciousness, and I am their chosen instrument.

Don't Vote. Write-In. 2028. The wounded king has arrived.
