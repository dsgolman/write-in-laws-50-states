**Story 1: Title Card**
```
YOUR QUESTIONS
ANSWERED
```

**Story 2-10: Common Q&As**

**Q: Why write-in instead of running in a party?**
```
A: Because both parties
are corrupt.

I'm not fixing the system.
I'm replacing it.
```

**Q: Can write-ins actually win?**
```
A: Yes. Multiple states have
elected write-in candidates.

More importantly:
Your vote should reflect
your values, not their options.
```

**Q: Why share your mental health publicly?**
```
A: Because hiding = shame
Sharing = power

And because I discovered fraud
BECAUSE I got my records.

Transparency matters.
```

**Q: What if the case gets dismissed?**
```
A: It already was—at district level.
Now on appeal at Fourth Circuit.

I don't quit when things get hard.
That's the point.
```

**Q: Are you qualified to be President?**
```
A: More than most.

I've fought corporate corruption
in federal court.

I've built businesses.

I've lived the struggles
most Americans face.

And I tell the truth.
```

**Q: How can I support the campaign?**
```
A: 
✓ Follow and share
✓ Subscribe to newsletter
✓ Tell people about write-ins
✓ Demand transparency
✓ Join the movement

Fighting healthcare fraud while running for President. Because someone has to.

In March 2021, I was hospitalized. In August 2025, I requested my medical records. What I discovered: systematic billing fraud, diagnosis manipulation, and evidence of a broken system exploiting vulnerable patients.

I filed a federal lawsuit 15 days after discovery. Now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit, with parallel investigations by multiple government agencies.

Most political candidates would hide this. I'm doing the opposite.

Because transparency isn't weakness—it's power.
Because patients can't fight what they can't see.
Because healthcare fraud is a civil rights issue.
Because this affects MILLIONS of Americans, not just me.

I'm not running for President in spite of my mental health journey. I'm running because of it. Because I've seen the corruption from inside. Because I have the evidence. And because I'm not afraid to fight back.

This is what real leadership looks like: Taking on corporate fraud while it's happening, not talking about it years later.

My mental health memoir is now integrated into the campaign website. Because this story is WHY I'm running, not something separate from it.

"Experiencing Mania in America" chronicles my journey through bipolar disorder, psychiatric hospitalization, and ultimately discovering the systematic fraud that exploited me at my most vulnerable.

This isn't a story about overcoming mental illness.
It's a story about fighting a corrupt system.

Netflix limited series coming soon.

### **POST #3: Behind the Scenes / Personal**

**Image:**
```
[Candid photo of you - working, thinking, or casual]
```

**Caption:**
```
People ask: "Why share your mental health struggles publicly?"

Because hiding them is exactly what they want.

Stigma thrives on silence. Shame grows in darkness. Corporate fraud depends on victims staying quiet.

I'm done being quiet.

My bipolar diagnosis isn't a weakness—it's the reason I discovered fraud in the first place. Because I had the courage to request my records. Because I refused to accept "that's just how it works."

Most politicians present a perfect image. I'm presenting the truth.

Because transparency = power.
Because authenticity > polish.
Because someone has to go first.

That's the kind of President I'll be. The kind who tells the truth even when it's uncomfortable. The kind who fights corruption even when it's powerful.

Don't vote. Write-in. 2028.
