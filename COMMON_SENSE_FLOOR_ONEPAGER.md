# 🟢 The Common Sense Floor — One Pager

**Principle:**  
Every American deserves a baseline of dignity before they can climb.  
This is not utopia — it’s **common sense.**

---

## The Six Guarantees
1. **Health** — Basic medical + mental health care access.  
2. **Nutrition** — No hunger in a surplus nation.  
3. **Shelter** — Housing as a baseline, not a luxury.  
4. **Connectivity** — Internet as a utility.  
5. **Economic Floor** — Unconditional cash floor (pilot ~$500/mo).  
6. **Education & Reskilling** — Free K-12 + lifelong reskilling for the AI era.  

**Slogan:**  
> *Raise the Floor. Unlock the Future.*

## Quick Counters

**“It kills work.”**  
Evidence: Finland UBI & Stockton SEED → Wellbeing ↑, jobs steady.  
➡️ Poverty is a bandwidth tax, not a work ethic issue.  

**“Housing First is a giveaway.”**  
Evidence: HUD & VA RCTs → housing stability ↑, costs ↓.  
➡️ Treating homelessness without housing is malpractice.  

**“Universal care too expensive.”**  
Evidence: Medicaid expansion → coverage ↑, mortality ↓, debt relief ↑.  
➡️ The most expensive care is the ER visit we could have prevented.  

**“UBI causes inflation.”**  
Evidence: $500 pilots → no local inflation spikes.  
➡️ If $500 breaks America, it was already broken.  

**“Federal overreach.”**  
➡️ One national floor, many state ladders — like Clean Air Act standards.  

**“Fraud risk.”**  
➡️ Direct transfers + modern verification = easier to audit than bureaucracy.

## Debate Cheat-Lines
- “Old politics argues about ladders. I build floors.”  
- “Poverty isn’t a moral failing; it’s an engineering problem.”  
- “The AI dividend belongs to the people who live under it.”  
- “We insure our cars better than our minds. That changes under CSF.”

**Core Claim:**  
We raise the floor so Americans can stand up. That’s not ideology — it’s common sense.
