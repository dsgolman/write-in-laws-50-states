# Instagram Cleanup & Optimization Guide

A clean, focused feed:

Since you can't truly "archive" highlights (they're either visible or deleted), here's the safe approach:

1. **Screenshot each highlight** (tap through and screenshot each story)
2. Save to a folder on your phone
3. **Then delete the highlights** from your profile
4. You can recreate them later if needed

3. Does this show authenticity OR professionalism?
4. Is this quality content?

**Step 2: Tag Posts**
As you scroll, mentally (or actually) tag each post:

- 🟡 **MAYBE** - Neutral/could go either way
- 🔴 **ARCHIVE** - Doesn't fit mission

**Step 3: Take Action**

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **Tip 1: Archive, Don't Delete**
You can always bring posts back. Start by archiving everything questionable, then unarchive selectively.

### **Tip 2: Preview Your Grid**
Use apps like "Preview" or "Planoly" to see what your grid will look like before posting.

### **Tip 3: Don't Overthink It**
If a post doesn't clearly support your message, archive it. You can always unarchive later.

### **Tip 4: Batch Process**
Don't do this over weeks. Set aside a few hours and get it done. Rip off the band-aid.

### **Tip 5: Save Everything First**
Before archiving, make sure you have copies of photos you might want later.

### **Tip 6: Ask a Friend**
Have someone look at your feed and point out posts that seem off-message. Fresh eyes help.
