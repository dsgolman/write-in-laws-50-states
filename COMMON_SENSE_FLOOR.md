# 🟢 The Common Sense Floor Policy

## Principle
Every person deserves a stable **floor of dignity** before they can climb.  
This is not utopia; it is the **minimum viable product of democracy**.

---

## The Six Guarantees

1. **Health** – Universal access to basic medical & mental health services.  
2. **Nutrition** – Guaranteed access to nutritious food; hunger has no excuse in a surplus nation.  
3. **Shelter** – Housing as baseline, not luxury.  
4. **Connectivity** – Internet access as a public utility.  
5. **Economic Floor** – A modest unconditional cash floor (pilot ~$500/month) scaled responsibly.  
6. **Education & Reskilling** – Free K-12 + debt-free reskilling to thrive in an AI economy.  

**Slogan:**  
> *Raise the Floor, Unlock the Future.*

- **Pilot & scale**: Time-boxed randomized controlled trials, sunset clauses, scale what works.

## Anticipated Critiques & Counter-Arguments

### 1) “This kills work ethic.”
- **Evidence**: Finland UBI, Stockton SEED → wellbeing ↑, employment stable or slightly ↑.  
- **Reply**: “Poverty isn’t a character flaw; it’s a bandwidth tax. Small cash floors restore bandwidth to work.”  

### 2) “Housing First just gives away apartments.”
- **Evidence**: HUD, VA, multiple RCTs → greater housing stability, reduced ER/jail costs.  
- **Reply**: “Treating homelessness without housing is like treating hypothermia without a blanket.”  

### 3) “Universal care is too expensive.”
- **Evidence**: Medicaid expansion → coverage ↑, mortality ↓, financial security ↑.  
- **Reply**: “The most expensive care is the care we deny until it becomes an ER visit.”  

### 4) “Mental health ROI is soft.”
- **Evidence**: WHO/Lancet → $1 → $4 return in productivity/health.  
- **Reply**: “We insure our cars better than our minds. That’s upside waiting to be unlocked.”  

### 5) “UBI causes inflation.”
- **Evidence**: $500/month pilots → no inflation spikes; macro inflation comes from supply shocks.  
- **Reply**: “If $500/month could break the U.S. economy, it was already broken.”  

### 6) “Federal overreach.”
- **Evidence**: Federal floors with state innovation work (e.g., Clean Air, Medicaid waivers).  
- **Reply**: “It’s not one-size-fits-all. It’s one floor, many ladders.”  

### 7) “Fraud will explode.”
- **Evidence**: Direct cash transfers are easier to audit than today’s complex welfare paperwork.  
- **Reply**: “Cash + modern verification leaves a cleaner trail than bureaucracy ever could.”
