## 🧭 Guiding Principles

* **Data First**: Treat fragmented election law like source code → normalize & document.
* **Narrative Power**: Trauma + Technology + Transformation + Truth.
* **Minimum Viable Product**: One successful state execution (Virginia) that generates national attention.
* **Openness**: Everything public, everything versioned, everything verifiable.
