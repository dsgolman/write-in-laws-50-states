# How to Format Your Substack Post

## The Issue
Substack uses a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, not raw markdown. When you paste markdown, it shows the symbols instead of formatting.

## Solution: Format It Manually in Substack

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### 1. TITLE
- Type your title at the top
- Select it and click the dropdown to make it "Heading" or "Title"
- **Title:** "Fighting Healthcare Fraud: When Personal Experience Becomes Political Mission"
- **Subtitle:** "Major updates to the Write-In Revolution 2028 campaign website"

#### 2. SECTION HEADERS
For each section header (like "The Healthcare Justice Case"):
- Type the text
- Select it
- Click the "H" button or dropdown to make it a "Heading 2" or "Heading 3"

**Section Headers:**
- The Healthcare Justice Case
- Experiencing Mania in America: Now Integrated
- Why I'm Sharing This Now
- What This Means for 2028
- Join the Fight
- The Road Ahead

#### 3. BOLD TEXT
For bold text (like "The Story:"):
- Type the text
- Select it
- Click the "B" button or press Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on Mac)

**Things to bold:**
- "The Story:"
- "Why This Matters:"
- "This is the connection:"
- "Explore the updates:"
- "Visit:"
- "Follow updates:"
- Key phrases you want to emphasize

#### 4. BULLET POINTS
For bullet lists:
- Click the bullet point button in the toolbar
- Type each item
- Press Enter for next item

**Or manually type:**
• Billing discrepancies...
• Diagnosis documentation...
• Systematic practices...

#### 5. LINKS
To add links:
- Type the text you want to link (like "campaign website")
- Select it
- Click the link button (chain icon)
- Paste your URL
- Click "Apply"

**Links to add:**
- "campaign website" → link to your site
- "healthcare justice case" → link to /healthcare-justice
- "mental health memoir" → link to /experiencing-mania

#### 6. ITALICS
For italic text (like "in spite of"):
- Type the text
- Select it
- Click the "I" button or press Ctrl+I (Cmd+I on Mac)

**Things to italicize:**
- "in spite of" (when contrasting with "because of")

#### 7. DIVIDERS
To add visual breaks:
- Click where you want a divider
- Type three dashes: ---
- Press Enter
- Substack will convert it to a horizontal line

**Or:**
- Use the "+" button and select "Divider"

#### 8. BLOCKQUOTES
For emphasized quotes:
- Select the text
- Click the quote button (") in toolbar

**Things that might work as blockquotes:**
- "Don't Vote. Write-In."
- "The revolution starts with truth."

## Quick Copy-Paste Method

### Option 1: Use Google Docs as Intermediary

1. Open Google Docs
2. Paste the markdown version
3. Format it there:
   - Bold: Ctrl+B
   - Heading: Ctrl+Alt+1, 2, 3
   - Bullets: Ctrl+Shift+8
4. Copy the FORMATTED version from Google Docs
5. Paste into Substack

This usually preserves formatting!

### Option 2: Format Directly in Substack

1. Paste the plain text version (SUBSTACK_POST_FORMATTED.txt)
2. Go through and format manually:
   - Select section titles → Make them H2 or H3
   - Select bold phrases → Click B button
   - Add bullets where needed
   - Add your links
