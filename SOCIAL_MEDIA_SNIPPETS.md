**Thread 1: Healthcare Justice Case Announcement**

üßµ MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT: I'm publicly detailing my civil rights case against systematic healthcare fraud.

This is why I'm running for President. üßµüëá

---

In 2021, I was hospitalized. In Aug 2025, I got my medical records.

What I found: systematic billing discrepancies, diagnosis manipulation, and evidence of fraud.

I filed a federal lawsuit 15 days later. It's now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit.

---

I've also filed complaints with:
‚Ä¢ VA Attorney General
‚Ä¢ HHS Office of Inspector General  
‚Ä¢ VA Medicaid Fraud Control

This isn't about one case. It's about MILLIONS of patients exploited by a broken system.

---

Healthcare transparency is a CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE.

Patients can't challenge what they can't see.

I'm fighting to expose what hospitals hide.

Most candidates hide their struggles.

I'm doing the opposite.

I'm not running IN SPITE OF my mental health journey.

I'm running BECAUSE OF IT.

Because I've seen the corruption from inside the system.

This case proves what kind of President I'll be:
‚úì Fights corporate fraud
‚úì Demands transparency
‚úì Stands up for civil rights
‚úì Uses evidence not rhetoric
‚úì Challenges the powerful

Real leadership looks like this. üßµ/end

**Subject: Transparency in Leadership: Why I'm Publicly Sharing My Healthcare Fraud Litigation**

I'm doing something most political candidates would never do: publicly detailing active litigation against a major healthcare corporation.

Here's why:

My 2021 hospitalization seemed routine. But when I exercised my HIPAA rights in August 2025 and obtained complete medical records, I discovered systematic billing discrepancies that raised serious questions about fraud.

Within 15 days, I filed a federal lawsuit. That case is now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, with parallel investigations by the Virginia Attorney General, HHS Office of Inspector General, and Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

**Why share this publicly?**

Because transparency isn't optional‚Äîit's essential. Because healthcare fraud affects millions of Americans who lack the resources to fight back. Because leadership means challenging corruption, even when it's powerful.

This litigation demonstrates the presidency I'm building toward 2028:
‚Ä¢ Evidence-based decision making
‚Ä¢ Willingness to challenge corporate power
‚Ä¢ Commitment to transparency
‚Ä¢ Focus on systematic reform

I'm also integrating my mental health memoir "Experiencing Mania in America" into the campaign. Not despite my bipolar diagnosis, but because it gave me insight into systematic problems that must be fixed.

The two-party system thrives on polished images and managed narratives. We're building something different: a movement based on truth, evidence, and courage.

**When Personal Experience Becomes Political Mission**

I have a major announcement about the Write-In Revolution 2028 campaign.

I'm publicly detailing my ongoing civil rights litigation against systematic healthcare fraud. This case is now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, with parallel investigations by multiple government agencies.

**The Story:**
In March 2021, I was hospitalized. In August 2025, I obtained my complete medical records and discovered evidence of billing fraud and diagnosis manipulation.

I filed a federal lawsuit 15 days after receiving those records.

**Why This Matters:**
- Healthcare fraud affects millions of Americans
- Patients can't challenge what they can't see
- Transparency is a civil rights issue
- Systematic problems need systematic solutions

I'm also integrating my mental health memoir "Experiencing Mania in America" into the campaign website. My experience with bipolar disorder and mania led me through a healthcare system I discovered was deeply corrupt.

I'm not running for President in spite of my mental health journey‚ÄîI'm running because of it. Because I've seen the system from inside. Because I know it's broken. Because I have evidence. And because I'm not afraid to fight.

**This is what leadership looks like:**
Fighting corruption even when it's powerful. Demanding transparency from institutions that hide. Standing up for civil rights when it's difficult.

That's what I'm doing in the courts right now.  
That's what I'll do in the White House.

**Title:** Presidential Candidate Publicly Details Active Healthcare Fraud Litigation

I'm Daniel Golman, running for President in 2028 via write-in campaign.

Today I'm doing something unusual for a political candidate: publicly detailing my active civil rights litigation against a major healthcare corporation.

**TL;DR:**
- 2021: Hospitalized in Virginia
- Aug 2025: Got medical records, found evidence of fraud
- Sept 2025: Filed federal lawsuit
- Oct 2025: Filed appeals + regulatory complaints
- Now: Fourth Circuit appeal pending + multiple investigations

**Why post this?**

Because transparency matters. Because healthcare fraud affects millions. Because most candidates would hide this‚ÄîI'm doing the opposite.

The full case details are on my campaign website (not linking to avoid self-promo rules, but it's on my profile).

I also integrated my mental health memoir "Experiencing Mania in America" because my bipolar diagnosis and hospitalization is what led me to discover the fraud.

**Questions welcome.** AMA about the case, the campaign, or healthcare fraud generally.
