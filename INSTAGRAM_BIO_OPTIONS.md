## 📝 CAPTION STYLE GUIDE

Your Instagram captions should match your bio energy:

**Style Elements:**
- ✅ Raw and honest
- ✅ Some edge/attitude
- ✅ Story-driven
- ✅ Calls to action
- ✅ Strategic emoji use
- ✅ Hashtags (but not too many - 5-10 max)

**Example Caption:**
```
They said I was crazy. Then I got the receipts. 📄

220 pages of medical records proving systematic healthcare fraud. Filed federal lawsuit 15 days after discovery. Now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit.

Most candidates would hide this. I'm doing the opposite.

Because transparency isn't weakness—it's power.

This is what real leadership looks like: Fighting corruption while it's happening, not talking about it after you've won.
