# ü§ù Contributing to Write-In Revolution

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This repository is both a **political project** and an **engineering dataset**. We treat election law like code: structured, normalized, and validated.

To keep everything consistent, please follow these guidelines when making contributions.

---

## üìù Ways to Contribute

* **Research**: Verify and document state write-in laws.
* **Data Entry**: Add or update rows in `50_state_write_in_master.csv`.
* **Dossiers**: Populate per-state markdown files in `/data/states/`.
* **Evidence**: Upload forms, statutes, and official guidance into `/assets/states/<state-slug>/`.
* **Code**: Improve validation scripts, CI workflows, or tooling in `/writein_pipeline/`.

2. Make your changes (data, dossier, or code).
3. Run local validation.

## ‚úä Philosophy

This is more than code. Every contribution helps build a **public, open-source map** of ballot access ‚Äî turning fragmented election laws into a structured, accessible dataset.

Together, we‚Äôre **engineering a movement**.
