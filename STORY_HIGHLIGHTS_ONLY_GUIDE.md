**Tip 2: Add to highlights immediately**
Right after posting stories, save them to the highlight so they don't disappear after 24 hours.

I've provided all the text above - just copy, paste into Instagram story, format nicely, and post.

As your campaign progresses, add new stories to existing highlights (case updates, campaign milestones, etc.)
