Fighting Healthcare Fraud: When Personal Experience Becomes Political Mission

Major updates to the Write-In Revolution 2028 campaign website

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

I'm writing to share two major updates to our campaign—both of which represent the core of why I'm running for President in 2028.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE HEALTHCARE JUSTICE CASE

Today, I'm publicly detailing my ongoing civil rights litigation against systematic healthcare fraud. This isn't just a legal case—it's a fight for transparency, accountability, and patient rights that affects millions of Americans.

The Story:

In March 2021, I was hospitalized under a Virginia Temporary Detention Order. What should have been a straightforward medical experience became something far more troubling when I exercised my HIPAA rights in August 2025 and requested my complete medical records.

What I discovered shocked me:

• Billing discrepancies that raised serious questions about how patients are charged

• Diagnosis documentation that didn't match the clinical notes throughout my hospitalization  

• Systematic practices that suggest this isn't an isolated incident, but a pattern

I couldn't discover any of this until I obtained my complete medical records in August 2025. Within 15 days of receiving those records, I filed a federal lawsuit. That case is now on appeal in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

I've also filed formal complaints with:

• Virginia Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division
• U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General  
• Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit

Why This Matters:

This case represents everything wrong with American healthcare:

• Patients can't challenge what they can't see. Without access to complete records and billing documentation, fraudulent practices remain hidden.

• Healthcare transparency is a civil rights issue. Patients deserve to understand how they're diagnosed, treated, and billed.

• Corporate accountability matters. Large healthcare corporations should be held to the same ethical standards as individual providers.

• Systematic fraud requires systematic solutions. Individual lawsuits aren't enough—we need regulatory enforcement and policy reform.

The full details are now available on the campaign website.

EXPERIENCING MANIA IN AMERICA: NOW INTEGRATED

I've also integrated my mental health memoir, "Experiencing Mania in America," into the campaign website.

This isn't a separate project—it's central to understanding why I'm running.

My experience with mania led me through America's mental healthcare system. What I discovered wasn't just inadequate treatment—it was systematic billing fraud that exploited vulnerable patients at their most difficult moments.

This is the connection:

Personal mental health journey → Discovery of healthcare fraud → Civil rights litigation → Presidential campaign for systematic reform

I'm not running for President in spite of my mental health journey. I'm running because of it.

Because I've seen the system from the inside.  
Because I know it's broken.  
Because I have the evidence to prove it.  
And because I'm not afraid to fight back.

You can read the full memoir and learn more on the campaign website.

WHY I'M SHARING THIS NOW

Most political candidates hide their struggles. They sanitize their stories. They present a perfect image.

I'm doing the opposite.

Because authenticity matters.  
Because transparency is power.  
Because the American people deserve leaders who tell the truth—even when it's uncomfortable.

The two-party system is built on polished lies and carefully managed images. We're building something different: a movement based on truth, evidence, and the courage to challenge corrupt institutions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR 2028

This healthcare fraud case demonstrates exactly what kind of President I'll be:

✓ Fights corruption even when it's powerful  
✓ Demands transparency from institutions that hide behind complexity  
✓ Stands up for civil rights when it's difficult  
✓ Uses evidence not empty rhetoric  
✓ Takes on systematic problems not just symptoms

Real leadership means challenging corporate fraud.  
Real leadership means exposing broken systems.  
Real leadership means fighting for people who can't fight back alone.

That's what I'm doing in the courts right now.  
That's what I'll do in the White House.

THE ROAD AHEAD

The Fourth Circuit appeal is pending.  
Multiple regulatory investigations are active.  
The Netflix limited series is in development.  
The 2028 campaign is building momentum.

This is just the beginning.

Healthcare fraud affects millions of Americans. Mental health stigma silences countless voices. Corporate power corrupts our institutions. The two-party system protects the status quo.

We're going to change that.

Not with empty promises.  
Not with polished lies.  
But with evidence, courage, and the determination to fight for what's right.

Don't Vote. Write-In.

The revolution starts with truth.
