## Engagement Responses (Pre-Written)

### **If someone asks "Why share this publicly?"**
"Because transparency isn't optionalâ€”it's essential. Patients can't fight what they can't see. By sharing this publicly, I'm demonstrating the kind of leadership America needs: evidence-based, transparent, and willing to challenge corruption."

### **If someone questions timing/political motivation:**
"I filed this lawsuit 15 days after receiving my medical records in August 2025. The case was already in motion before I made it public. I'm sharing now because transparency is central to my campaignâ€”I won't hide from voters what I'm fighting for in the courts."

### **If someone asks about case details:**
"The case is active litigation, so I'm careful about what I discuss publicly. The key allegations involve billing discrepancies and diagnosis documentation that didn't match clinical notes. Full details are in the filed court documents and on my website."

### **If someone shares their own healthcare fraud story:**
"Thank you for sharing this. You're exactly why this fight matters. Stories like yours prove this isn't isolatedâ€”it's systematic. If you're comfortable, consider reporting to HHS-OIG or your state AG. The more people who speak up, the harder it is for institutions to hide."

### **If someone questions credibility:**
"I have 220 pages of medical records, filed court documents in federal court, and active investigations by multiple government agencies. This isn't speculationâ€”it's documented evidence. Website has the details."
