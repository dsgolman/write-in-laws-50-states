ðŸ§µ On October 23, 2025, Alabama executed Anthony Boyd with nitrogen gas.

He was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony.
No physical evidence.
No DNA.
No video.

He maintained his innocence until death.

This is irreversible injustice. ðŸ§µ
```

**Thread continued:**

```
1/ Anthony Boyd's execution exposes the core problem with capital punishment:
   
   It's final. Forever.
   
   No second chances after the state kills.
```

```
2/ Since 1973, 192 death row inmates have been exonerated.
   
   That's 192 people who almost died for crimes they didn't commit.
   
   How many innocent people have actually been executed?
   
   We'll never know. Because they're dead.
```

```
3/ Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable.
   
   Studies show 70% of wrongful convictions involve mistaken identification.
   
   Our justice system executed Boyd based on eyewitness testimony alone.
   
   That's not justice. That's Russian roulette.
```

```
4/ Capital punishment is the premeditated killing of a human being by the state.
   
   I cannot and will not support a system that kills with uncertain evidence.
   
   America deserves better than irreversible injustice.
```

```
5/ My position on criminal justice reform:
   
   âœ“ Abolish capital punishment nationwide
   âœ“ Raise evidence standards (DNA, video, physical proof only)
   âœ“ End prosecutorial misconduct
   âœ“ Support victims with resources, not executions
   
   Real justice doesn't kill.
```

```
6/ Anthony Boyd is dead.
   
   If there was even a 1% chance he was innocent, we executed a potentially innocent man.
   
   That's unacceptable.
   
   We need leadership that prioritizes justice over vengeance.
   
   That's why I'm running. ðŸ§µ/end

# Justice Denied: The Execution of Anthony Boyd

On October 23, 2025, the state of Alabama executed Anthony Boyd using nitrogen gas.

The facts of the case should trouble every American who believes in justice:

- **Conviction based solely on eyewitness testimony**
- **No physical evidence linking him to the crime**
- **Maintained innocence until execution**
- **No second chance once the state kills**

## The Irreversible Injustice

Capital punishment is final. Forever. There are no do-overs after an execution. 

Since 1973, the National Registry of Exonerations reports that 192 death row inmates have been exonerated. These are people who came within days, weeks, or months of being executed for crimes they didn't commit.

The question we must ask: **How many innocent people have been executed?**

We'll never know. Because they're dead.

## The Evidence Problem

Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. The Innocence Project reports that eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions, implicated in 70% of DNA exonerations.

Yet our justice system executed Anthony Boyd based primarily on eyewitness testimony.

That's not justiceâ€”that's Russian roulette with human lives.

## My Position on Criminal Justice Reform

The execution of Anthony Boyd represents everything wrong with our criminal justice system. As a presidential candidate, I am calling for comprehensive reform:

### 1. Abolish Capital Punishment Nationwide

Life without parole serves justice without the irreversible risk of executing innocent people. It provides closure for victims' families while maintaining the possibility of exoneration if new evidence emerges.

### 2. Raise the Evidence Standard

Any case resulting in capital punishment must meet the highest evidentiary standard:
- Physical evidence (DNA, fingerprints, etc.)
- Video documentation
- Multiple independent sources of evidence
- NO execution based solely on eyewitness testimony

### 3. End Prosecutorial Misconduct

District attorneys who withhold exculpatory evidence must face criminal charges. The conviction should not matter more than the truth.

### 4. Reform Eyewitness Procedures

Implement science-based identification procedures including double-blind lineups, sequential presentation, and expert testimony about memory fallibility.

### 5. Support Victims Differently

Instead of pouring millions into capital punishment trials and appeals, invest in:
- Victim counseling and support services
- Medical care for victims and families
- Financial assistance for those affected by crime
- Programs that prevent violence in the first place

## Why This Matters

I'm not telling you this to be controversial. I'm telling you because this is what real leadership looks like: standing up for justice even when it's uncomfortable.

Anthony Boyd is dead. If there was even a 1% chance he was innocent, we executed a potentially innocent person.

That should be unacceptable to every American.

Capital punishment has failed our nation. It's time to replace it with a system that prioritizes justice, truth, and human dignity.

That's the kind of president America needsâ€”one who fights for reform, transparency, and the abolition of state-sanctioned killing.

ðŸ”´ Statement on the Execution of Anthony Boyd

On October 23, 2025, Alabama executed Anthony Boydâ€”convicted solely on eyewitness testimony with no physical evidence linking him to the crime.

This represents a fundamental failure of justice that we must address.

As a presidential candidate, I am calling for the abolition of capital punishment and comprehensive criminal justice reform.

Key reforms needed:

âœ“ End state-sanctioned killingâ€”life without parole serves justice without irreversible risk

âœ“ Raise evidence standardsâ€”require DNA, video, or physical proof for any capital case

âœ“ End prosecutorial misconductâ€”hold district attorneys accountable for withholding evidence

âœ“ Reform eyewitness proceduresâ€”implement science-based identification protocols

âœ“ Support victims with resources instead of executionsâ€”fund counseling, medical care, and violence prevention

Since 1973, 192 death row inmates have been exonerated. How many innocent people have been executed? We'll never know. Because they're dead.

Capital punishment has failed. It's time for a justice system based on truth, evidence, and human dignityâ€”not irreversible error.

This is the kind of leadership America needs: willing to challenge broken systems and fight for reform.
